# Album of the Year Spreadsheet

The purpose of this repository is to build a workflow to take album of the year lists from [Album of the Year](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/) directly to a spreadsheet on [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpxZunN4M8gvnsireG4TEPSlA-pxo8Ta9Y6Kj8zgWwg/).

This project was collaborative with [Rob Mitchum](https://twitter.com/robmitchum), as I used the format he has used in the past to create this spreadsheet. I helped him to automate the process.
